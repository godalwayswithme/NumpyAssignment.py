    "### 1. What is a Python library? Why do we use Python libraries?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform common tasks. Libraries contain modules, which are files that contain functions, classes, and variables. We use Python libraries to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reuse code: Instead of writing common functions from scratch, you can use libraries.\n",
    "- Save time: Libraries provide tested and optimized code.\n",
    "- Simplify code: Libraries can handle complex tasks with simple function calls.\n",
    "- Increase productivity: By using libraries, you can focus on writing the unique parts of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the difference between a NumPy array and a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy Array:**\n",
    "  - Fixed-size container of elements of the same type.\n",
    "  - Supports advanced mathematical operations and functions.\n",
    "  - Efficient storage and performance, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "  - Multidimensional arrays (e.g., 2D, 3D arrays).\n",
    "  - Requires the NumPy library.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **List:**\n",
    "  - Dynamic-size container of elements that can be of different types.\n",
    "  - More general-purpose and flexible.\n",
    "  - No built-in support for advanced mathematical operations.\n",
    "  - Typically used for simpler or heterogeneous collections of data.\n",
    "  - Part of the standard Python library.\n",

    "### 3. Find the shape, size, and dimension of the following array:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "array = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],\n",

    "### 8. Describe the difference between np.random.rand and np.random.randn:\n",
    "- **np.random.rand:** Generates random numbers from a uniform distribution over [0, 1).\n",
    "- **np.random.randn:** Generates random numbers from a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).\n",
